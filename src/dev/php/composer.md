# PHP 컴포저 설치
---
컴포저를 이용하여 다양한 응용 패키지와 연동을 합니다.

<br>

## 다운로드
---

https://getcomposer.org/download/ 로 접속을 합니다.

터미널에서 다음과 같이 실행합니다.

```
php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');"
```

<br>

## 설치하기
다운로드 받은 컴포터 파일을 설치합니다.

```
php -r "if (hash_file('sha384', 'composer-setup.php') === '756890a4488ce9024fc62c56153228907f1545c228516cbf63f885e036d37e9a59d27d63f46af1d4d07ee0f76181c7d3') { echo 'Installer verified'; } else { echo 'Installer corrupt'; unlink('composer-setup.php'); } echo PHP_EOL;"
```

설치를 진행합니다.

```
php composer-setup.php 
```

설치후, 기존 설치파일은 제거 합니다.
```
php -r "unlink('composer-setup.php');"
```

<br>

## 컴포저 실행하기
---
어디서든지 컴포저가 실행이 될 수 있도록 파일을 복사해 둡니다.

```
mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
```

이제 composer 명령을 실행해 봅니다.

```
